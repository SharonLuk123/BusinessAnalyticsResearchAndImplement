1. Algorithm Implementation
The algorithm involves a recursive function to find the best positions for the passenger to book.The recursive
function finds the positions of north,south, east and west to book seats accordingly as a whole.
In the cases of not having enough empty seats to book the group of passengers, the recursive function will create
seperated groups.Given a table with 10 columns and 8 rows in which T represents the seat is taken, C represents
column and R represents row.

The first scenario: 
The output would be the following if the flight passenger books 7 seats : 

C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C8 C9 C10
R1 T1 T1 T1 T1 T1 T1 T1 
R2
R3
R4
R5
R6
R7
R8

The second scenario:
If a second passenger decides to book 5 seats, the output would be the following :

C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C8 C9 C10
R1 T1 T1 T1 T1 T1 T1 T1 T2 T2 T2
R2                         T2 T2
R3
R4
R5
R6
R7
R8

The third scenario:
It can also create seperate passenger group bookings if there are not enough empty seat positions :

C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C8 C9 C10
R1 T1 T1 T1 T1 T1 T1 T1 T2 T2 T2
R2 Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti       Ti T2 T2
R3 Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti       Ti Ti Ti
R4 Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti
R5 Ti          Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti
R6 Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti
R7 Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti
R8 Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti

The fourth scenario:
If the third passenger decided to book 7 seats, firstly the 4 seats would be found and then the remaining 3 seats
available followed by another seat :

C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C8 C9 C10
R1 T1 T1 T1 T1 T1 T1 T1 T2 T2 T2
R2 Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti T3 T3 Ti T2 T2
R3 Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti T3 T3 Ti Ti Ti
R4 Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti
R5 Ti T3 T3 T3 Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti
R6 Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti
R7 Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti
R8 Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti Ti T3

At this point, if a another passenger decides to book more than one seat eg 5 seats. The seat allocation will fail
as there is only one seat remaining.

2. Running the program 
To run the program , simply create a directory or a folder where it contains seat_assign_16203615, data.db ( as
required in the assignment) and also bookings.csv. Before running the program, the user should make sure 
flightSeatingAssign(nrows, seats, theSeatings, bookings) remains uncommented in the main.
- Open up terminal.
- The user can simply cd into the directory with python3 installed. 
- Type in python3 seat_assign_16203615. 
The program should run smoothly with results outputting in terminal.

3. Testing
The first case was to test if all the passenger seats were booked.
The second case was to test if the passenger seat could not be allocated.
The third case was to test some passenger bookings were there are seperated groups.
Make sure to comment flightSeatingAssign(nrows, seats, theSeatings, bookings) during the running of the tests. 
To run through the testing, simply scroll down to the main in the python file and uncomment the 
following test cases :

Test case 1 :

#fullyBookedSeatsTestOne(nrows, seats, theSeatings)

Test case 2 :

#absentSeatBookingTestTwo(nrows, seats, theSeatings)

Test case 3 :

#bookingsTestThree(nrows, seats, theSeatings)
